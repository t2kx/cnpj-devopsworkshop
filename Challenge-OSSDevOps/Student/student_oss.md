## Challenge 2 – GitHub Project Boards: Agile Project Management
[Back](challenge01.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

In the last challenge we learned that Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, GitHub includes Project Boards. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. Please review this [introduction to Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) before proceeding with the challenge.

### Challenge

1. Create a basic kanban project board for the repository you created in the [previous challenge](challenge01.md) ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-project-board)).

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 2 – GitHub Project Boards: Agile Project Management
[Back](challenge01.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

In the last challenge we learned that Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, GitHub includes Project Boards. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. Please review this [introduction to Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) before proceeding with the challenge.

### Challenge

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 2 – GitHub Project Boards: Agile Project Management
[Back](challenge01.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

In the last challenge we learned that Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, GitHub includes Project Boards. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. Please review this [introduction to Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) before proceeding with the challenge.

### Challenge

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 2 – GitHub Project Boards: Agile Project Management
[Back](challenge01.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

In the last challenge we learned that Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, GitHub includes Project Boards. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. Please review this [introduction to Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) before proceeding with the challenge.

### Challenge

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 2 – GitHub Project Boards: Agile Project Management
[Back](challenge01.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

In the last challenge we learned that Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, GitHub includes Project Boards. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. Please review this [introduction to Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) before proceeding with the challenge.

### Challenge

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 2 – GitHub Project Boards: Agile Project Management
[Back](challenge01.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

In the last challenge we learned that Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, GitHub includes Project Boards. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. Please review this [introduction to Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) before proceeding with the challenge.

### Challenge

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 2 – GitHub Project Boards: Agile Project Management
[Back](challenge01.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

In the last challenge we learned that Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, GitHub includes Project Boards. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. Please review this [introduction to Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) before proceeding with the challenge.

### Challenge

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 2 – GitHub Project Boards: Agile Project Management
[Back](challenge01.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

In the last challenge we learned that Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, GitHub includes Project Boards. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. Please review this [introduction to Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) before proceeding with the challenge.

### Challenge

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 2 – GitHub Project Boards: Agile Project Management
[Back](challenge01.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

In the last challenge we learned that Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, GitHub includes Project Boards. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. Please review this [introduction to Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) before proceeding with the challenge.

### Challenge

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 2 – GitHub Project Boards: Agile Project Management
[Back](challenge01.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

In the last challenge we learned that Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, GitHub includes Project Boards. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. Please review this [introduction to Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) before proceeding with the challenge.

### Challenge

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 2 – GitHub Project Boards: Agile Project Management
[Back](challenge01.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

In the last challenge we learned that Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, GitHub includes Project Boards. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. Please review this [introduction to Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) before proceeding with the challenge.

### Challenge

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 2 – GitHub Project Boards: Agile Project Management
[Back](challenge01.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

In the last challenge we learned that Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, GitHub includes Project Boards. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. Please review this [introduction to Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) before proceeding with the challenge.

### Challenge

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 2 – GitHub Project Boards: Agile Project Management
[Back](challenge01.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

In the last challenge we learned that Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, GitHub includes Project Boards. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. Please review this [introduction to Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) before proceeding with the challenge.

### Challenge

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 2 – GitHub Project Boards: Agile Project Management
[Back](challenge01.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

In the last challenge we learned that Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, GitHub includes Project Boards. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. Please review this [introduction to Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) before proceeding with the challenge.

### Challenge

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 2 – GitHub Project Boards: Agile Project Management
[Back](challenge01.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

In the last challenge we learned that Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, GitHub includes Project Boards. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. Please review this [introduction to Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) before proceeding with the challenge.

### Challenge

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 2 – GitHub Project Boards: Agile Project Management
[Back](challenge01.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

In the last challenge we learned that Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, GitHub includes Project Boards. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. Please review this [introduction to Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) before proceeding with the challenge.

### Challenge

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 2 – GitHub Project Boards: Agile Project Management
[Back](challenge01.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

In the last challenge we learned that Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, GitHub includes Project Boards. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. Please review this [introduction to Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) before proceeding with the challenge.

### Challenge

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 2 – GitHub Project Boards: Agile Project Management
[Back](challenge01.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

In the last challenge we learned that Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, GitHub includes Project Boards. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. Please review this [introduction to Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) before proceeding with the challenge.

### Challenge

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 2 – GitHub Project Boards: Agile Project Management
[Back](challenge01.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

In the last challenge we learned that Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, GitHub includes Project Boards. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. Please review this [introduction to Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) before proceeding with the challenge.

### Challenge

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 2 – GitHub Project Boards: Agile Project Management
[Back](challenge01.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

In the last challenge we learned that Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, GitHub includes Project Boards. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. Please review this [introduction to Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) before proceeding with the challenge.

### Challenge

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 2 – GitHub Project Boards: Agile Project Management
[Back](challenge01.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

In the last challenge we learned that Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, GitHub includes Project Boards. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. Please review this [introduction to Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) before proceeding with the challenge.

### Challenge

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 2 – GitHub Project Boards: Agile Project Management
[Back](challenge01.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

In the last challenge we learned that Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, GitHub includes Project Boards. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. Please review this [introduction to Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) before proceeding with the challenge.

### Challenge

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:

## Challenge 08 - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying via Terraform
[Back](challenge07.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge09.md)

### Introduction

Organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based services for application workloads. The development teams using these cloud-based services are able to operate with greater independence from the operational constraints of their underlying infrastructure. For most organizations, this means navigating a transition:

* from a relatively static pool of homogeneous infrastructure in dedicated data centers,
* to a distributed fleet of servers spanning one or more cloud providers.

To handle this shift, many organizations treat their cloud-based infrastructure as code—managing and provisioning it collaboratively. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) uses infrastructure as code to provision any cloud infrastructure. Terraform provides a collaborative workflow for teams to safely and efficiently create and update infrastructure at scale.

### Challenge

In this challenge, the objective is to get familiar with Terraform's command line interface (CLI) and use its templating mechnism along with the [Azure provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) to deploy the voting application that has been containerized and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The tasks for this challenge are:
1. Download and setup Terraform locally
2. Create a Terraform template file that will deploy the containerized voting application onto Azure Container Instance



### Success Criteria

The complete this challenge successfully:
*   Ensure Terraform CLI is installed locally
*   Create a Terraform  ```*.tf``` template file utilizing the Azure provider
* Deploy the containerized voting application to ACI via Terraform

## Challenge 09 - Monitoring: Generating and listening to application metrics
[Back](challenge08.md) // [Home](../readme.md)

### Introduction

Monitoring applications & application servers is an important part of the DevOps. It is important to continuously monitor applications and servers for application exceptions, server CPU & memory usage, or storage spikes. It is often desired to get notifications and/or alerts if CPU or memory usage goes up for a certain period of time or a service of your application stops responding so appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate those failures or exceptions.

With monitoring, there are a number tools out there such Azure Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus and others. In this challenge, we will take a look at the Prometheus monitoring, a popular free & open-source project for monitoring services.

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Deploy a Prometheus instance
    * [**Hint**] Though it is possible to deploy Prometheus to VMs, most implementations of Prometheus server are done through containers. Use ACI will be an efficient way to deploy a Prometheus instance.
2. Setup application monitoring on the voting application and have those metrics be emmited to the deployed Prometheus instance.

### Success Criteria

The successfully complete this section deploy a the voting application and have its metrics be emitted to Prometheus.

## Challenge 2 – GitHub Project Boards: Agile Project Management
[Back](challenge01.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

In the last challenge we learned that Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, GitHub includes Project Boards. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. Please review this [introduction to Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) before proceeding with the challenge.

### Challenge

1. Create a basic kanban project board for the repository you created in the [previous challenge](challenge01.md) ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-project-board)).

2. Delete the default notes added to the **To do** column.

3. Configure automation for the columns of the board as follows ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-automation-for-project-boards)):
   - **To do** - move newly added issues to this column.
   - **In progress** - move reopened issues and newly added/reopened pull requests to this column.
   - **Done** - move closed issues and merged pull requests/closed pull request with no commits to this column.

4. Create an issue for this and each of the remaining challenges, and verify that the new issues appear in the **To do** column of the project board ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue)).

5. Assign the `challenge 2` issue to another member of your team, and have them assign their `challenge 2` issue to you.

6. Close the `challenge 2` issue assigned to you, and verify that the closed issue appears in the **Done** column of the project board.

7. Reopen the `challenge 2` issue, and verify that the reopened issue appears in the **In Progress** column of the project board.

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesn’t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

   ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))


### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.

## Challenge 05 - Test: Developing a testing mechnism
[Back](challenge04.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.

## Challenge 06 - Package Application: Create Azure Container Registry and Push App Image to ACR
[Back](challenge05.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

Now that we have the containerized application running locally. Lets send the packaged application (aka containerized application) to an image repository. Any flavor of image repository can be used. However, in this hack use Azure Container Registry (aka ACR). Generally ACR is not sufficient and a package manager like JFrog's Artifactory, Nexus, npm or GitHubs Package Registry. However, to keep this application build simple we will not source our application dependencies from any of these sources but instead will use publicly avaliable [dependencies](Resources/Challenge-03/app/src/requirements.txt). 

### Challenge

The tasks in this challenge are to:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Setup local Docker runtime to point to the newly created ACR
3. Push the containerized voting application to ACR
   

### Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge have the containerized application be pushed to ACR to be ready to be deployed anywhere.

## Challenge 07 - CICD via Jenkins: Continuous Build
[Back](challenge06.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge08.md)

### Introduction

Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify errors as early as possible.

**Jenkins** is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile and test Python source code and build a container from the successful test results. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

* Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven, Gradle, or PyBuilder
* Execute a shell script
* Archive a build result
* Running software tests
* Create containers
* Deploy containers

### Challenge

In this challenge, we will get familar with **Jenkins** and develop a set of *Jobs* and try to string together a couple of *Jobs* to make a pipeline that will test and create the container that have the voting application within it.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Deploy and setup a Jenkins instance
    * [Use Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins)
    * [**Advanced**] Deploy a Jenkins instance as an [Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)
2. Create a ```Jenkins Job``` that will: 
    *   Pull latest voting application code from the GitHub repo you created earlier in [Challenge 1](challenge01.md).
    *   Create a Docker container image
    *   Push the created container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Success Criteria

The success for this challenge is to be able deploy a functional Jenkins server and create a set of Jobs within that server that pull code, create container image and push that image up to a container repository.
