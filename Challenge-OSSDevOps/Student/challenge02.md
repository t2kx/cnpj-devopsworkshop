### Introduction

In the last challenge we learned that Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, GitHub includes Project Boards. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. Please review this [introduction to Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) before proceeding with the challenge.

### Challenge

1. Create a basic kanban project board for the repository you created in the [previous challenge](challenge01.md) ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-project-board)).

2. Delete the default notes added to the **To do** column.

3. Configure automation for the columns of the board as follows ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-automation-for-project-boards)):
   - **To do** - move newly added issues to this column.
   - **In progress** - move reopened issues and newly added/reopened pull requests to this column.
   - **Done** - move closed issues and merged pull requests/closed pull request with no commits to this column.

4. Create an issue for this and each of the remaining challenges, and verify that the new issues appear in the **To do** column of the project board ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue)).

5. Assign the `challenge 2` issue to another member of your team, and have them assign their `challenge 2` issue to you.

6. Close the `challenge 2` issue assigned to you, and verify that the closed issue appears in the **Done** column of the project board.

7. Reopen the `challenge 2` issue, and verify that the reopened issue appears in the **In Progress** column of the project board.

8. Close the `challenge 2` issue.

You should have experienced using GitHub Project Boards for Agile project management.
