# What the Hack: OSS DevOps 

## Challenge 3 - GitHub Repositories: Introduction

[Back](challenge02.md) // [Home](../readme.md) // [Next](challenge04.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. Since the language you use for development doesnâ€™t have much of an impact on how we do DevOps we have provided you a simple Python web application to use.

1. Clone the GitHub repository you created in the [first challenge](challenge01.md) to your local computer ([hint](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Download the code for the application [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-03/app)

3. Unzip the download and copy the contents into the root of the repository you cloned in step #1.

4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository using VS Code or your favorite Git client.

   **Be sure to include a # sign followed by the issue number for this challenge to the Git commit message.**
   
   For example: lets say you want to use the commit comment `my first commit` and your issue number is 55 your, your commit message should look like this  `my first commit #55`.

### Success Criteria

You should be able to go to the GitHub site and under your repository see your code.
