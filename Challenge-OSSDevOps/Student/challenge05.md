### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**
   

### Success Criteria

If you are not a developer or not familar with Python do go ahead and skip this section but do review the [provided solution](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSSDevOps/Student/Resources/Challenge-05/app) to get a taste of how unit testing works.
